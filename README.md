### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alberto-castellano-mora/alberto-castellano-mora.github.io.git
```

Rename the folder if you‚Äôd like, e.g. your-name-portfolio.

---

### 3. Start your Build Process

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your app will be served locally at *http://localhost:xxxx*.

---

### 4. Customize Your Web Page

Here are the most important parts:

- In **package.json** file, update line.

``` json
"homepage": "https://alberto-castellano-mora.github.io/",
```

with:

``` json
"homepage": "https://your-user-name.github.io/",
```

- Change Alberto's name and experiences to your own.
- Add the images you'd like to assets and public folders.
- Customize the style in files index.css and other .css inside styles folder.

### 5. Install GitHub Pages

```bash
npm install gh-pages
```

### 6. Create a GitHub Repository

Name it exactly:

```lua
your-user-name.github.io
```

Example:

```lua
alberto-castellano-mora.github.io
```

### 7. Initialize & Push Your Code

Navigate to your project folder in your terminal and run:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-username.github.io.git
git push -u origin main
```

**Substitute the url with that of your project**

### 8. Deploy to GitHub Pages

Once you have pushed your code, run in your terminal:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

Steps 7 and 8 should have pushed your code to main and created a second Branch called gh-pages. The gh-pages branch is automatically created by the deploy script (npm run deploy). That branch only contains the built static files (index.html, JS bundles, CSS, etc.) that GitHub Pages serves. **‚ö†Ô∏è Never manually edit or push to gh-pages**.

### 9. View Your Site

Wait a few minutes to see your changes in *https://your-user-name.github.io/*

‚è≥ Changes may take a few minutes to appear. If you still see a 404 after ~5 minutes, try redeploying.

‚ö†Ô∏è If you still see a 404 after ~5 minutes try this:

1. Go to your github remote repository and click on **Settings**.
2. On the left menu, click on Pages
3. **Build and deployment** should be set to **Deploy from a branch** and the chosen branch should be **main**, not **None**.

### 10. Updating Your Site

Whenever you make changes, push them to main and re-deploy:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "update portfolio"
git push
npm run deploy
```
